These skills are relevant to a role as an IT Business Analyst. However, there is no explicit mention of experience in software implementation, process improvement, or working with business users to document processes, which are key aspects of the job description at Forever Living. Bailey's teamwork skills, demonstrated through leading a soccer team, suggest potential for collaboration in a team-oriented environment. Overall, while there are overlapping skills, there may be gaps in direct experience related to software solution deployment and business requirements analysis."
